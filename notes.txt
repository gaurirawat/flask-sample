You can use the following attributes to fetch the data sent with the request:
request.data → Access incoming request data as string
request.args → Access the parsed URL parameters. Returns ImmutableMultiDict
request.form → Access the form parameters. Return ImmutableMultiDict
request.values → Returns CombinedMultiDict which combines args and form
request.json → Returns parsed JSON data if mimetype is application/json
request.files → Returns MultiDict object which contains all uploaded files. Each key is the name of the file and value is the FileStorage object.
request.authorization → Returns an object of Authorization class .It represents an Authorization header sent by the client.

Blueprints allow us to separate various endpoints into subdomains. (just like java controller path and then multiple subpaths after that.)
eg: home is a blueprint. enter, leave are inside it. This creates home/enter, home/leave paths.
